# ReactProjects_Summer2022

My return to MERN_Stack after nearly a year. This time, I managed to connect the app's Front-end to Back-end ðŸ˜‚, with the information of which was stored at MongoDB database.

This project's inspiration comes from Facebook Messenger, which is a prevalent ChatApp in the public nowadays. At the first stage, I will complete some of the important features for 
for a Chat Application, such as storing messages of each user and real-time sockets for chatting events. Then, I may integrate AI-related technologies, such as Natural Language Processing, 
to create an automatic ChatBot for my app.

Happy coding!
